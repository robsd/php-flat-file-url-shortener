# php-flat-file-url-shortener üîó

A flat file URL shortener written in PHP.

## Getting setup

1. [Download](https://github.com/robsd/php-flat-file-url-shortener/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract this repo.
2. Create a **.txt** file in the **urls** directory for what you want your shortened URL to end with e.g. for **yourdomain.com/example** you would create **example.txt** in the **urls** directory.
3. Inside your newly created **.txt** file, paste the URL you wish to shorten e.g. **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ** and make sure there's **NOTHING ELSE** in the file (no blank lines either).
4. Upload everything to your PHP-enabled web server.

## Need a hint?

I have created an example shortened URL **urls/example.txt** based on the above setup guide.
